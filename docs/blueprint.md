# **App Name**: Polyphonic Debris SoundSculptor

## Core Features:

- Intuitive Sound Parameter Controls: Adjust attack, decay, base frequency, harmony, timbre, waveform pairs, vibrato, reverb, and echo using dedicated UI elements optimized for touch interactions.
- Real-time Audio Synthesis and Preview: Utilize Web Audio APIs for immediate, high-fidelity sound synthesis and a live preview of generated effects.
- WAV Export Functionality: Export any created sound effect to a standard WAV audio file for external use.
- AI Sound Description Tool: A generative AI tool (Gemini) that interprets text descriptions from the user to intelligently adjust sound parameters, creating effects like 'space gun laser' or 'forest ambiance'.
- Local Save and Load: Persist and retrieve sound effect creations directly within the browser's local storage for quick access.
- Cloud Storage with Firebase: Securely save and retrieve user-generated sound effects presets to and from a Firebase backend.
- Dynamic Dark Mode Toggle: Enable users to switch between light and dark UI themes, respecting the requested dark mode experience.

## Style Guidelines:

- Color scheme is dark-oriented, chosen for extended use in low-light environments, complementing the 'softer tone' aspect. Primary actions and interactive elements are highlighted with a purplish-blue color (#795BED) which evokes a sophisticated yet creative, retro-tech vibe. This hue has a brightness (60%) suitable for visibility on a dark background.
- The background features a deeply desaturated purplish-grey (#1D1A21) derived from the primary's hue. This provides a subtle underlying consistency and a non-distracting foundation in the chosen dark mode scheme (brightness 12%, saturation 15%).
- An accent color of vibrant blue (#2E80F0) is used for call-to-action buttons, visual indicators, and subtle highlights. Its distinct hue and higher saturation (80%) provide contrast against both the primary and background, adding an energetic spark (brightness 50%).
- Headlines and body text will use 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif font, for its computerized, techy, and scientific feel, aligning with the sound synthesis tool's aesthetic.
- Line-art icons for controls and parameters, reminiscent of vintage audio equipment or waveforms, will maintain a clean and focused visual style appropriate for dark mode and tech-centric design.
- The interface will be organized into logical control panels with responsive design, ensuring touch-friendly, large controls and a clear hierarchy for ease of use across devices, including touch-enabled ones.
- Subtle, smooth transitions will accompany parameter adjustments, with potential visualizers to offer real-time feedback on the sound's waveform or characteristics without being distracting, enhancing the 'spacious' feel.
